This is a Node.js application using Express that provides two endpoints: `/write` and `/read`.

Here's what each endpoint does:

1.  `/write`: When a GET request is made to this endpoint, it creates a new file inside a directory named "TimeStamp" with the current date and time as part of the file name. It writes some content into the file indicating the current date and time.
    
2.  `/read`: When a GET request is made to this endpoint, it reads the content of the latest file created in the "TimeStamp" directory and sends it as the response.
    

Explanation:

*   The app uses Express.js for handling HTTP requests.
*   It imports `fs` (File System) module to perform file operations.
*   It imports `format` function from the `date-fns` library to format the current date and time.
*   It sets up a basic Express server listening on port 4000.
*   The `today` variable holds the current date and time in the format 'dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm-ss'.
*   The `filePath` variable holds the path of the file to be created inside the "TimeStamp" directory.
*   The `content` variable holds the content to be written into the file, including the current date and time.
*   The `/write` route writes the content to the file specified by `filePath` when a GET request is made to it.
*   The `/read` route reads the content from the file specified by `filePath` when a GET request is made to it.
*   If an error occurs during file operations, appropriate error messages with status codes are sent as responses.

Make sure you have the required permissions set up for the file system operations and that the "TimeStamp" directory exists in the root directory of your application. Also, ensure that the `date-fns` library is installed in your project.
